Title: Power Simulations for RNA-sequencing
Description: Recent development of very sensitive RNA-seq protocols, such as Smart-seq2 and CEL-seq
           allows transcriptional profiling at single-cell resolution and droplet devices make single
           cell transcriptomics high-throughput, allowing to characterize thousands or even millions
           of single cells. In powsimR, we have implemented a flexible tool to assess power and sample
           size requirements for differential expression (DE) analysis of single cell and bulk RNA-seq
           experiments. For our read count simulations, we (1) reliably model the mean, dispersion and
           dropout distributions as well as the relationship between those factors from the data. (2)
           Simulate read counts from the empirical mean-variance and dropout relations, while offering
           flexible choices of the number of differentially expressed genes, effect sizes and analysis
           tools (for normalisation, DE, etc). (3) Finally, we evaluate the power over various sample
           sizes. The number of replicates required to achieve the desired statistical power is mainly
           determined by technical noise and biological variability and both are considerably larger
           if the biological replicates are single cells. powsimR can not only estimate sample sizes
           necessary to achieve a certain power, but also informs about the power to detect DE in a
           data set at hand. We believe that this type of posterior analysis will become more and more
           important, if results from different studies are to be compared. Often enough researchers
           are left to wonder why there is a lack of overlap in DE-genes across similar experiments.
           PowsimR will allow the researcher to distinguish between actual discrepancies and
           incongruities due to lack of power.
