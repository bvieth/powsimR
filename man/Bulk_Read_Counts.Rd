\description{
250 ng of Universal Human Reference RNA (UHRR; Agilent Technologies; catalog #740000) and ERCC spike-in control mix I (Life Technologies) were used and cDNA was synthesized as described in the Smart-Seq2 protocol from Picelli et al. 2013.\cr
Base-calls were performed with Illumina bcl2fastq.\cr
All cDNA reads were aligned with NextGenMap 0.4.12. Smart-seq2 reads were mapped to GRCh37 (hg19) and ERCC synthetic spike-in reference.
Reads were assigned to genes using FeatureCount method in Rsubread package.\cr
